# Recommender-Systems
During my Bachelor's and Master's degree, I worked on Recommender Systems, collaborative filtering field. I used MoveLens 100K dataset.
Here you can find my old codes using Matlab and R.


I wrote Fuzzy C-Means, SOM, K-Means, and Genetic-Fuzzy C-Means algorithms in Matlab. On the other hand, to implement K-Means using Map-Reduce, I used R programming language.
